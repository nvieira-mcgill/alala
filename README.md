# alala

Overview
========
A pipeline for the MegaCam (a.k.a. MegaPrime) and Wide-field Infra-Red Camera (WIRCam) instruments of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Includes the following:

- Stacking (co-addition) of individual exposures
- Obtaining astrometric solutions
- Point-Spread Function (PSF) photometry
- Aperture photometry
- Putting PSF/aperture photometry together to produce light curves

This pipeline was used for all of these steps in the following paper describing our CFHT MegaCam follow-up of the gravitational wave event GW190814:

[Vieira, N., Ruan, J.J, Haggard, D., Drout, M.R. et al. 2020, ApJ, 895, 96, 2. *A Deep CFHT Optical Search for a Counterpart to the Possible Neutron Star - Black Hole Merger GW190814.*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200309437V/abstract)  


The code is named after the ʻalalā, the Hawaiian crow.



Documentation
=============

Detailed documentation (WIP) for all modules can be found [here](https://alala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In the future, example scripts/notebooks will be added.



Installation
============

Currently, needs to be installed directly from github. May be install-able with ``conda`` and/or ``pip`` in the future.

**Dependencies:**

- ``numpy``
- ``scipy``
- ``matplotlib``
- [``astropy``](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/)
- [``photutils``](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [``astroquery``](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [``pyraf``](https://pypi.org/project/pyraf/) (python wrapper for ``iraf``, only for stacking)
- [``stsci.tools``](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stsci.tools) (only for stacking)

**Non-Python:**

- [``astrometry.net``](http://astrometry.net/use.html)
- [``iraf``](http://ast.noao.edu/data/software) (only for stacking)

The code will be migrated from ``iraf`` to some other software (e.g. ``swarp``) in the future.
